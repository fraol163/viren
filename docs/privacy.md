# Data Sovereignty & Privacy Policy

Viren was built with a fundamental distrust of centralized AI logging. As developers, our source code and our internal architectural discussions are trade secrets. This document outlines the technical safeguards Viren uses to ensure your data remains under your absolute control.

---

## 1. The "Local-First" Architecture
Viren does not have a central server. There is no "Viren Account" or "Viren Cloud." 
- **Direct Pipe**: When you type a prompt, the binary on your machine opens an encrypted TLS connection directly to the AI provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
- **No Telemetry**: Viren does not track how many times you launch it, which models you use, or your geographic location.
- **Zero-Logging**: We do not store your prompts. We literally cannot see them.

---

## 2. Data Persistence (On-Disk)
All data generated by Viren stays in the `~/.viren/` directory.

### Session History
Located in `~/.viren/tmp/`, these are JSON files containing:
- Every prompt you sent.
- Every AI response received.
- Timestamps and model metadata.
**Access Control**: These files are created with standard Unix permissions (`0600`), meaning they are readable only by your user account.

### Configuration
`~/.viren/config.json` stores your preferences and "Neural Profile." It **never** stores your API keys unless you manually paste them there (which we strictly advise against).

## 3. Network Privacy

### API Requests
All requests are sent over HTTPS. Your data is encrypted in transit between your ISP and the AI provider.

### Web search (`!w`)
When you search the web via Viren:
1. Your query is sent to the **Brave Search API**.
2. Brave returns search results.
3. Viren fetches the text of those results directly from the target websites.
**Privacy Note**: The websites you scrape will see your local IP address in their server logs as a standard HTTP request.

---

## 4. The Enterprise Safeguard: Ollama
For users in high-security environments (Government, FinTech, Healthcare), Viren provides a "Total Blackout" mode via **Ollama**.

- **How it works**: By selecting `!p ollama`, Viren routes all logic to a locally running model on your CPU or GPU.
- **The Result**: **Zero data leaves your machine**. Even the AI reasoning is local. This is the gold standard for privacy.

---

## 5. Security Recommendations
1.  **Environment Variables**: Always store API keys in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`. Never hard-code them.
2.  **Regular Cleanup**: If you work on a shared machine, run `rm -rf ~/.viren/tmp/*` after your session to wipe the conversation history.
3.  **VPN**: Use a VPN to mask your IP when using the web-scraping features (`!s` and `!w`).

**Your intelligence is proprietary. Viren keeps it that way.**
